## 🎯 About This Project

This is the **MASTER IMPLEMENTATION** of the CourseCart system. It is a fully functional, enterprise-grade microservices application designed to showcase modern development practices, featuring strict service isolation and resilient inter-service communication.

All features are fully implemented, and there are no trainee assignments or stubs in this version.

## 🏗 System Architecture

The application uses a **Microservices Architecture** with four independently deployable business services. Each service maintains its own isolated MySQL database, preventing cross-domain joins.

- **Spring Cloud Gateway** (`:8080`) — single entry point; handles routing and CORS.
- **Spring Cloud Consul** (`:8500`) — service discovery and health monitoring.
- **WebClient & Resilience4j** — asynchronous HTTP calls equipped with circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures.

## 💻 Tech Stack

### Backend

- **Java 21** & **Spring Boot 3.2.x** (Spring Cloud)
- **Spring Data JPA** & **Hibernate**
- **Spring Cloud Gateway** & **Spring Cloud Consul**
- **WebClient** (Inter-service communication)
- **Resilience4j** (Circuit Breaker)
- **MySQL** (Four Independent Databases)

### Frontend

- **Angular 16.2.x** & **TypeScript**
- **RxJS**
- **Bootstrap 5** (responsive UI via CDN)
- **Route Guards** (`AuthGuard`, `AdminGuard`) for role-based page protection

---

## 🛠 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **JDK 21** installed and on `PATH`
- **Node.js v18+** and **Angular CLI** installed globally
- **MySQL** running on default port `3306`
- **HashiCorp Consul** running on default port `8500`

### Setup & Run

**1. Start Consul:**

```bash
consul agent -dev
```

**2. Initialize Databases:**
Execute the following schema and seed scripts to initialize the 4 isolated microservice databases.

```bash
mysql -u root -p < backend/user-service/src/main/resources/user_db.sql
mysql -u root -p < backend/catalog-service/src/main/resources/catalog_db.sql
mysql -u root -p < backend/commerce-service/src/main/resources/commerce_db.sql
mysql -u root -p < backend/enrollment-service/src/main/resources/enrollment_db.sql
```

**3. Start Microservices** (run each in a separate terminal via `mvn spring-boot:run`):

```bash
cd backend/api-gateway           && mvn spring-boot:run
cd backend/user-service          && mvn spring-boot:run
cd backend/catalog-service       && mvn spring-boot:run
cd backend/enrollment-service    && mvn spring-boot:run
cd backend/commerce-service      && mvn spring-boot:run
```

**4. Launch Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend/coursecart-ui
npm install
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:4200`

## 🔒 API Design & Security

This project uses **Frontend-Managed Identity and Access Control**:

**Authentication:**

- Login through User Service.
- User credentials are validated against stored credentials.
- User information is stored in `localStorage`.
- `AuthGuard`/`AdminGuard` control frontend navigation.

**Backend Identity:**

- `userId` is explicitly supplied through request body/path/query.
- The backend does **not** receive `X-User-Id` or `X-User-Role` headers.

**Authorization:**

- Frontend route guards provide UI-level role restrictions.
- The backend does **not** provide centralized authentication or authorization.
- Microservices use YAML (`application.yml`) to enforce strict isolation constraints instead of properties files.
